Usage guide:
- The Source.ipynb notebook contains the exploratory data analysis and the model for traditional machine learning.
- The BERT_VER1.ipynb notebook contains the BERT model for classification with high learning rate (for comparison purpose).
- The BERT_VER2.ipynb notebook contains the final BERT model for classification with fine tuned learning rate for usage.
- The train.csv is the dataset from the kaggle jigsaw challenge. This dataset is split 70% and 30% for training and testing accross all models.
